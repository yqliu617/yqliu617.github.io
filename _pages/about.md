<b><font size="6"><font style="font-family: Gill Sans">About me</font></font></b> 
<br>
I am a third year PhD student at [AMSS](http://english.amss.cas.cn), where my advisors are [Baohua Fu](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/) and [Laurent Manivel](https://manivel.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). I defended my thesis at May 13th, 2025.<br>
During 2023 and 2025, I was visiting [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/fr/). <br>



<b><font size="6"><font style="font-family: Gill Sans">Research interest</font></font></b> 
<br>
Complex algebraic geometry, with a focus on the geometry of homogenous spaces and their linear sections. <br><br>
